- 👋 Hi, I’m @IITian-Ankit

🎓 I'm an Electrical Engineering student at IIT goa with a strong interest in **VLSI Design** and **Embedded Systems**. I’m passionate about blending hardware and software to build smart, efficient systems that solve real-world problems.

## 🛠️ Skills
- Languages: Verilog, VHDL, Python, C++
- Tools & Platforms: ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, MATLAB, Git
- Areas of Interest: RTL Design, FPGA Development, Microcontrollers, Low-level System Design

## 🚀 Projects
- 🧠 **RISC-V Processor Core**  
  Built both **single-cycle** and **pipelined** versions of a **RISC-V processor**, gaining a deeper understanding of instruction set architecture, datapath design, and performance optimization.

- 💊 **Medication Reminder System**  
  Designed using **VHDL** on the **DE10-Lite FPGA board**, this project helps users stay on top of their medication schedules using digital logic and alert systems.

## 🌱 Always Learning
I’m continuously exploring new tools and technologies in the VLSI and embedded systems space. Topics that currently excite me include:
- ASIC Design Flows
- High-Level Synthesis (HLS)
- Real-time Embedded Systems
- Sensor Integration for Intelligent Hardware

## 🤝 Let's Connect!
I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and connecting with others who are passionate about tech. If you’re into digital design, embedded systems, or just love to build cool stuff—feel free to reach out!
